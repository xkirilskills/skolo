                    A car, or an automobile, is a motor vehicle with wheels. Most definitions of cars state that they
                    run
                    primarily on roads, seat one to eight people, have four wheels, and mainly transport people, not
                    cargo.

                    French inventor Nicolas-Joseph Cugnot built the first steam-powered road vehicle in 1769, while
                    French-born Swiss inventor François Isaac de Rivaz designed and constructed the first internal
                    combustion-powered automobile in 1808. The modern car—a practical, marketable automobile for
                    everyday
                    use—was invented in 1886, when German inventor Carl Benz patented his Benz Patent-Motorwagen.
                    Commercial
                    cars became widely available during the 20th century. One of the first cars affordable by the masses
                    was
                    the 1908 Model T, an American car manufactured by the Ford Motor Company.
