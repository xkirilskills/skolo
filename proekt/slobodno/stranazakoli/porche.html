                <p>Dr. Ing. h.c. F. Porsche AG, usually shortened to Porsche is a German automobile manufacturer
                    specializing in high-performance sports cars, SUVs and sedans, headquartered in Stuttgart,
                    Baden-Württemberg, Germany. The company is owned by Volkswagen AG, a controlling stake of which is
                    owned by Porsche Automobil Holding SE. Porsche's current lineup includes the 718, 911, Panamera,
                    Macan, Cayenne and Taycan. Ferdinand Porsche (1875–1951) founded the company called "Dr. Ing. h. c.
                    F. Porsche GmbH" with Adolf Rosenberger and Anton Piëch in 1931. The main offices was at
                    Kronenstraße 24 in the centre of Stuttgart. Initially, the company offered motor vehicle
                    development work and consulting, but did not build any cars under its own name. One of the first
                    assignments the new company received was from the German government to design a car for the people;
                    that is, a Volkswagen. This resulted in the Volkswagen Beetle, one of the most successful car
                    designs of all time. The Porsche 64 was developed in 1939 using many components from the
                    Beetle.</p>
