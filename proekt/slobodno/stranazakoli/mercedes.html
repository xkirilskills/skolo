            <p>Mercedes-Benz commonly referred to as Mercedes and sometimes as Benz, is a German luxury and commercial
                vehicle automotive brand established in 1926. Mercedes-Benz AG (a Mercedes-Benz Group subsidiary
                established in 2019) is headquartered in Stuttgart, Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg, Germany. Mercedes-Benz AG
                produces consumer luxury vehicles and light commercial vehicles badged as Mercedes-Benz. From November
                2019 onwards, Mercedes-Benz-badged heavy commercial vehicles (trucks and buses) are managed by Daimler
                Truck, a former part of the Mercedes-Benz Group turned into an independent company in late 2021. In
                2018, Mercedes-Benz was the largest brand of premium vehicles in the world, having sold 2.31 million
                passenger cars.

                The brand's origins lie in Daimler-Motoren-Gesellschaft's 1901 Mercedes and Carl Benz's 1886 Benz
                Patent-Motorwagen, which is widely regarded as the first internal combustion engine in a self-propelled
                automobile. The slogan for the brand is "the best or nothing".</p>
