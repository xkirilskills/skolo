                <p>Automobili Lamborghini S.p.A. is an Italian manufacturer of luxury sports cars and SUVs based in
                    Sant'Agata Bolognese. The company is owned by the Volkswagen Group through its subsidiary Audi.

                    Ferruccio Lamborghini (1916–1993), an Italian manufacturing magnate, founded Automobili Ferruccio
                    Lamborghini S.p.A. in 1963 to compete with Ferrari. The company was noted for using a rear
                    mid-engine, rear-wheel drive layout. Lamborghini grew rapidly during its first decade, but sales
                    plunged in the wake of the 1973 worldwide financial downturn and the oil crisis. The firm's
                    ownership changed three times after 1973, including a bankruptcy in 1978. American Chrysler
                    Corporation took control of Lamborghini in 1987 and sold it to Malaysian investment group Mycom
                    Setdco and Indonesian group V'Power Corporation in 1994. In 1998, Mycom Setdco and V'Power sold
                    Lamborghini to the Volkswagen Group where it was placed under the control of the group's Audi
                    division.

                    New products and model lines were introduced to the brand's portfolio and brought to the market and
                    saw an increased productivity for the brand. In the late 2000s, during the worldwide financial
                    crisis and the subsequent economic crisis, Lamborghini's sales saw a drop of nearly 50 per cent.

                    Lamborghini currently produces the V10-powered Huracán, and the Urus SUV powered by a twin-turbo V8
                    engine. Their flaghip model, the V12-powered Aventador ended production in 2022, and will be
                    succeeded by the Revuelto, a V12/electric hybrid, as a 2024 model. In addition, the company produces
                    V12 engines for offshore powerboat racing.</p>
