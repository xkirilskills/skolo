                <p>The Toyota Supra is a sports car and grand tourer manufactured by the Toyota Motor Corporation
                    beginning in 1978. The name "supra" is derived from the Latin prefix, meaning "above", "to surpass"
                    or "go beyond".

                    The initial four generations of the Supra were produced from 1978 to 2002. The fifth generation has
                    been produced since March 2019 and went on sale in May 2019. The styling of the original Supra
                    was derived from the Toyota Celica, but it was both longer and wider. Starting in mid-1986, the
                    A70 Supra became a separate model from the Celica. In turn, Toyota also stopped using the prefix
                    Celica and named the car Supra. Owing to the similarity and past of the Celica's name, it is
                    frequently mistaken for the Supra, and vice versa. The first, second and third generations of the
                    Supra were assembled at the Tahara plant in Tahara, Aichi, while the fourth generation was assembled
                    at the Motomachi plant in Toyota City. The 5th generation of the Supra is assembled alongside the
                    G29 BMW Z4 in Graz, Austria by Magna Steyr.</p>
