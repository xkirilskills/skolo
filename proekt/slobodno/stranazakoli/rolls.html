                <p>Rolls-Royce Motor Cars Limited is a British luxury automobile maker which has operated as a wholly
                    owned subsidiary of BMW AG since 2003 â€“ as the exclusive manufacturer of Rolls-Royce-branded motor
                    cars. The company's administrative and production headquarters are located on the 42-acre (17 ha)
                    Goodwood Estate in Goodwood, West Sussex, England, United Kingdom.[3]

                    From 1906 to 2003, motor cars were manufactured and marketed under the Rolls-Royce brand by
                    Rolls-Royce Motors. The Rolls-Royce Motor Cars subsidiary of BMW AG has no direct relationship to
                    Rolls-Royce-branded vehicles produced before 2003, other than having briefly supplied components and
                    engines. The Bentley Motors Limited subsidiary of Volkswagen AG is the direct successor to
                    Rolls-Royce Motors and various other predecessor entities that produced Rolls-Royce and Bentley
                    branded cars between the foundation of each company and 2003, when the BMW-controlled entity started
                    producing cars under the Rolls-Royce brand.</p>
