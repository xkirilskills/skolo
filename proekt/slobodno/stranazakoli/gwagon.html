                <p>The Mercedes-Benz G-Class, sometimes colloquially called the G-Wagen is a four-wheel drive automobile
                    manufactured by Magna Steyr (formerly Steyr-Daimler-Puch) in Austria and sold by Mercedes-Benz.
                    Originally developed as a military off-roader, later more luxurious models were added to the line.
                    In certain markets, it was sold under the Puch name as Puch G until 2000.

                    The G-Wagen is characterised by its boxy styling and body-on-frame construction. It uses three fully
                    locking differentials, one of the few passenger car vehicles to have such a feature.

                    Despite the introduction of an intended replacement, the unibody SUV Mercedes-Benz GL-Class in 2006,
                    the G-Class is still in production and is one of the longest-produced vehicles in Daimler's history,
                    with a span of 44 years. Only the Unimog surpasses it.[4] In 2018, Mercedes-Benz introduced the
                    second-generation W463 with heavily revised chassis, powertrain, body, and interior. In 2023,
                    Mercedes-Benz announced plans to launch a smaller version of the G-Class, named "little G"â€”though no
                    definitive date was given for the launch.

                    The 400,000th unit was built on 4 December 2020.[6]

                    The success of second-generation W463 led to the 500,000th unit milestone three years later on April
                    2023. The 500,000th model was a special one-off model with agave green paintwork, black front
                    end, and amber turn signal indicators in tribute to the iconic 1979 press release photo of jumping
                    W460 240 GD.</p>
